Find method of informing user of "unique constraint failed" for the purposes of id's -- or similar (US#1)
(query for user in db --> if None, allow user creation, if a user exists with form.id.data then throw error)

# Sprint Review

Date/Time: 04/16/2024 -- 2:23pm

Participants: Owen Pick, Sage Johnson, Victoria Lassner, Dawson Cummings, Alexander Anguiano

Notes...

US#1 and US#2 are complete. US#3 is mostly done, but we are ironing out the details on models.py. 
Our current implementation of models.py does not allow us to retrieve/query the list of offers from current_user.
Our work in the second sprint will focus on fixing models.py, then moving onto US#4, US#5, and US#6.

# Sprint Retrospective

Date/Time: 04/16/2024 -- 2:47pm

Participants: Owen Pick, Sage Johnson, Alexander Anguiano, Victoria Lassner, Dawson Cummings

Notes...

We will have daily scrum meetings on Monday & Wednesday @ 8:00pm, and Saturday & Sunday @ 1:00pm.

Attendance is highly-suggested, but not mandatory. "If you'll say you'll be there, then be there."
If a team member does not attend, then they must reach out to the group to catch up to speed.

Until next time!
