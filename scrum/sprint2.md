# Sprint Review

Date/Time: 04/23/2024 -- 3:01pm

Participants: Sage Johnson, Owen Pick, Victoria Lassner, Alex Anguiano, Dawson Cummings

Notes...

US#4, US#5, and US#6 have all been worked on. US#6 is done, but needs some work to fix bugs. With the work we have done during Sprint 2, our program is looking pretty good! Functionality is working well, but we will need to work on polishing up some minor issues. ALL User Stories have been successfully completed.

We will need to merge two different working copies of the program, and then push to the dev branch.

Selenium tests and the Dockerfile still need completion.
