# Sprint Retrospective

Date/Time: 04/28/2024 -- 1:23pm

Participants: Owen Pick, Sage Johnson, Dawson Cummings, Victoria Lassner

Notes...

Scrum meetings have been a major help. Our team is working well. Some of us were tag-teaming with others via Teams throughout the project. We seem to be fitting into our niche/synergy with each other.

We don't like working with structural changes less than 48 hours til the deadline.

We should consider communicating with the team before making any major structural changes. This is to prevent any unnecessary time spent on changes that may have already been implemented, especially in a different way that does not match with the new changes.
